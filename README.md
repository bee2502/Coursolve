The Oxford Internet Institute has assembled a team of qualitative and quantitative researchers to explore how social learning unfolds in MOOCs (Some foundational research papers can be found here and here). The team is now conducting a randomized control in a MOOC to answer the following research questions: 

1. What is the impact of targeted email recommendations on social learning patterns?

2. How can we use the effects of email recommendations on social learning to improve learners' experiences through technological and pedagogical innovations?

As a participant in this digital internship, you'll be responsible for working together to complete the following:

1. Task 1 -- Parse dataset and compute basic participation metrics.  Expected amount of time: 5-10 hours.  

2. Task 2 -- Create individual and week-by-week visualizations of participation trends. Expected amount of time: 5-10 hours. 

3. Task 3 -- Combine analysis and visualizations into comprehensive report with key findings and insights that tie back to the driving research questions.  Expected amount of time: 10-15 hours.
